# Information
## Inspiration
We have three main inspirations:
1. We feel very annoyed when receiving spam tokens and NFTs also.
2. We want to hide the amount or the token card when the amount is large, or I just want to keep it secret.
3. As a developer, when I test and develop, I create too many tokens/NFTs to test.

## What it does
Our product is a Chrome extension, and it's name is **Clean My Wallet** *(CMW)*. CMW will help you to hide the token card or remove it forever. And can do the same thing with NFTs. However, we will allow hiding a whole collection of NFTs.
